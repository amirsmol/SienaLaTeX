SienaLaTeX
==========

A repository for my LaTeX templates.

This contains templates for LaTeX documents that I tend to create, LaTeX structures that I tend to use (such as tables, lists, and figures), and LaTeX commands.



This repository is organized as follows:  
1)	Documents for this projects that are in the text file format. E.g., LICENSE.md and README.md.  
2)	articoli: A LaTeX template for articles.  
3)	curriculum_vitae: A LaTeX template for curriculum vitaes and resumes.  
4)	presentazione: A LaTeX template for creating presentation slides.  
5)	rapporto: A LaTeX template for reports.  
6)	scripts: A Ruby script to remove temporary files.  

For each subdirectory, a Makefile is provided to typeset the document with LaTeX (and add references, if necessary).
